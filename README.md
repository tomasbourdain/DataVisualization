# World Happiness Report Dashboard

The World Happiness Report ranks countries based on various measures of happiness and well-being, such as income, social support, life expectancy, and freedom to make life choices. The Dashboard aims to provide insight into the factors that contribute to people's happiness and inform policy decisions to improve the well-being of citizens around the world.

Furthermore, a dashboard can also help identify gaps in the data and prompt further research to better understand the factors that contribute to happiness scores in individual countries.

Future work on the dashboard could involve collecting more data about individual countries to further analyze and understand the country-specific factors that influence happiness scores, which can ultimately lead to policy recommendations aimed at improving citizens well-being.
